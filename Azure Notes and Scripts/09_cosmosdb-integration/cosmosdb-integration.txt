# CosmosDB Integration

## Problems I Faced
- Long connection string.
- One missing character broke everything.
- Mongoose failed to connect.

## Fix
1. Copied connection string directly from Azure.
2. Stored it as a secret:
   mongo-uri="mongodb://..."

3. Mapped it:
   MONGO_URI=secretref:mongo-uri

## Lessons Learned
Never type the connection string manually.
