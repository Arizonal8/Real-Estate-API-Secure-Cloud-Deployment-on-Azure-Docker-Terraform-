# Initial Setup and Project Preparation

## Overview
This note explains how I started the Real Estate API project from scratch after cloning an open-source repo that was not deployment-ready.

## Problems I Faced
- The repo had no Dockerfile.
- No .env example.
- No deployment instructions.
- Folder structure was inconsistent.
- Config files were missing or incomplete.

## Steps I Took
1. Cloned the repo:
   git clone <repo-url>

2. Cleaned the project:
   - Removed unused folders.
   - Removed broken configs.
   - Reorganized the backend into:
     /src
     /config
     /routes
     /controllers
     /models

3. Created a new .env file:
   MONGO_URI=
   IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY=
   IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=
   IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=
   SMTP_USER=
   SMTP_PASS=

4. Updated config files to use environment variables:
   Example (config/index.js):
   export default {
     mongoUri: process.env.MONGO_URI,
     imagekit: {
       publicKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY,
       privateKey: process.env.IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY,
       urlEndpoint: process.env.IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT
     }
   }

## Lessons Learned
Always rebuild an open-source repo to match your deployment environment.
