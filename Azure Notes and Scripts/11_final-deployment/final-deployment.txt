# Final Deployment and Cleanup

## Problems I Faced
- Azure revision loop.
- Old configs still active.
- Secrets not applied.

## Final Steps
1. Deactivated all revisions.
2. Reset secrets.
3. Updated env vars.
4. Waited for Azure to create a new revision.
5. Confirmed logs:
   - Database connected
   - ImageKit connected
   - Server running

## Lessons Learned
A clean reset often solves everything.
