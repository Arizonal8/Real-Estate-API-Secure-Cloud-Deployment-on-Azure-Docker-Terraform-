# Debugging Azure Revisions

## Problems I Faced
- CrashLoopBackOff
- Old revisions restarting automatically
- Missing secrets causing crashes

## Commands I Used
az containerapp revision list
az containerapp revision deactivate

## Steps I Took
1. Listed all revisions.
2. Deactivated every broken revision.
3. Reset secrets.
4. Updated env vars.
5. Waited for Azure to create a new revision.

## Lessons Learned
If revisions keep failing, deactivate everything and rebuild.
