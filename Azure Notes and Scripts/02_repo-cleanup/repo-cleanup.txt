# Repo Cleanup and Restructuring

## Problems I Found
- Duplicate folders.
- Old configs that didn’t match my environment.
- Missing scripts.
- No clear entry point.

## Steps I Took
1. Removed unused folders:
   rm -rf old-config
   rm -rf legacy

2. Created a clean structure:
   /src
   /config
   /routes
   /controllers
   /models
   Dockerfile
   package.json

3. Added missing scripts to package.json:
   "scripts": {
     "start": "node src/index.js",
     "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
   }

4. Verified entry point:
   src/index.js:
   import app from './app.js'
   app.listen(4000, () => console.log("Server running"))

## Lessons Learned
A clean repo makes deployment easier.
