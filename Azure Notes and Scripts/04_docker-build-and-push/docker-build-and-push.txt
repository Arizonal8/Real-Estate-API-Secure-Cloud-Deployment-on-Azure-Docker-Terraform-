# Building and Pushing Docker Images

## Problems I Faced
- Dockerfile errors.
- Missing dependencies.
- Wrong working directory.

## Final Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["npm", "start"]

## Commands I Used
docker build -t arizonal8/realestate-api-lab .
docker push arizonal8/realestate-api-lab

## Lessons Learned
If it doesn’t run locally, it won’t run in Azure.
